## About Me

I am a Biomedical Engineering student working on research-driven healthcare solutions that combine applied machine learning, bio-signals, imaging data, and embedded systems. My current focus lies in prototyping systems that enhance diagnostics, remote monitoring, and early detection of clinical conditions.

I explore practical methods to bridge engineering design with clinical impact — through automated workflows, image processing, medical systems development, and data-based decision support.
